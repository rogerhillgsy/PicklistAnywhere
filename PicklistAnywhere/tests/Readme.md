# PicklistAnywhere Tests

I would have like to write some more useful unit tests for PicklistAnywhere, but after a day of struggling with Jest mocks and Typescript I've decided to park this for a while.

I have managed to get unit tests for PCF controls working before, and also react based tests, but I this this needs a little more study of react mocks to get  ```context.parameters.targetAttribute.attributes``` working in the way that I would like.
